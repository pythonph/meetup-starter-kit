# Python Meetup Group Starter Kit

#### Purpose of this guide
The main purpose of this guide to encourage people in other parts of the Philippines to start their own Python Meetup Group

#### I would like to organize a Python meetup. How do I start?
First off, you rock! It's so awesome that you want to organize a Python meetup in your city/place. We have good news for you -- organizing a meetup is not as complicated as it sounds.

Here's a checklist that might help:
- [ ]  **Code of Conduct**

   As an open community, we promote diversity and collaboration. We must adhere to the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) during meetups and other social events.

- [ ] **Venue**

   PythonPH meetups are usually held at company offices. These venues are often sponsored but if you can't find venue sponsors yet, that's totally fine. You can meet in any coffee shop, restaurant or even under a tree.

- [ ] **Attendees**

   You don't have to start big. Even if there are only 2 or 3 people, it should be fine.

- [ ] **Agenda**

   If you're just starting your meetup group and don't have talk topics and speakers in mind yet, it's totally fine to organize a "meet and greet" first.

   If you already have an idea for the the meetup topics and speakers, you can go ahead and invite those speakers you have in mind.

   Otherwise, you can come up with an activity that doesn't require a speaker for your first meetup.

   A Python meetup group would be very much like any hobby meetup group where people meet and hangout for a common interest (e.g board games, lan parties etc.) except we talk about Python and related tech.

In general, "simple is better than complex" ;)
The most important thing to keep in mind is you just need to start. You'll most likely meet likeminded people and come up with other ideas after your dry run :)

That's it! Good luck!
