Python Meetup Group Starter Kit

#### I would like to organize a Python meetup. How do i start?
First off, you rock! Organizing a meetup is not as complicated as it seems.

Here's a checklist that might help:
- Code of Conduct
 As an open community, we promote diversity and collaboration. We must adhere to the Python Community Code of Conduct during meetups and other social events. https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/
- Venue
 PythonPH meetups are usuallt held at company offices. These venues are often sponsored but if you can't find venue sponsors yet, that's fine. You can meet at any coffee shop or restaurant.
- Attendees
 You don't have to start big. Even if there are only < 10 people, it should be fine.
- Agenda
 If your just starting your meetup group and don't have talk topics and speakers in mind yet, it's totally fine to organize a "meet and greet" first. A Python meetup group would be very much like any hobby meetup group where people meet and hangout for a common interest (e.g board games, lan parties etc.).
